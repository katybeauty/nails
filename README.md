Welcome to KatyBeauty Salon! I’m Katy, a passionate nail and lash artist with a deep love for both beauty and technique. Originally from Iran, I moved to the Netherlands a few years ago to be with my partner. Armed with a master’s degree in physical education and an artistic spirit, I ventured into the world of nail art at a European school in my homeland. But I didn’t stop there—I continuously honed my craft through advanced courses to elevate myself from a nail technician to a true nail master.

 

Alongside nails, I trained in eyelash services to become a versatile beauty expert. With over six years of experience, I founded my own business in the Netherlands in 2022, and I’m incredibly proud of the glowing reviews I’ve received from my wonderful clients on Treatwell.
